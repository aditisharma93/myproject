<b><h3>Flexible Event Management</h3>
At Outsourced Events, it’s our job to turn your ideas into a reality. Central to this is our flexible and responsive event management service. We can provide this as a complete end-to-end service or as individual discrete elements that can work alongside your own internal event planning and marketing resources. However you want to work, we are agile enough to fit to your needs.
No two events are quite the same which is why we take the time to understand exactly what it is you want to achieve, before putting together a comprehensive event management plan. Depending on your requirements, this could cover everything from creative concept development through to logistics, finance planning, event marketing and post-event follow up.</b>

<h3><b>Events that Stick in the Mind</h3>
A successful corporate event should stick in the mind, not fade into mundanity. We know the importance of creating a lasting impression for your attendees and vendors alike, but we’re also committed to making sure your event achieves everything you’ve set out to do. This is why we’ll never let artistic vision override established business goals and logistical realities.
Our passion for event planning is matched only by our experience, professionalism and friendliness. We love working with our clients and as a result they love working with us.</b>

<h3><b>Experts in Technology Event Management</h3>
We have been working with major blue-chip technology firms since 2001 and are one of the leading UK events management and marketing service providers to the industry. We have worked with some of our clients for over a decade and over the years have come to view many of them as colleagues and friends, as much as clients.
As well as technology event management, we are also fully committed to adopting new technologies as an agency. Our print on demand badging and registration service is a prime example of this, using proprietary software to allow instant badge printing on site and present a slick, professional first contact for delegates.</b></p>
